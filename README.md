CODE FUNCTIONALITY:

This is my first website coded with Java on IntelliJ. 
It implements Spring, a MySQL database accessed through Spring Data, as well as a Thymeleaf template engine. 
It contains 11 web pages, 5 independent entity models, controllers, services and repositories, and 1 REST controller. 
It is equipped with Spring Security and supports i18n for English and Spanish.

For the Front-End I used a bootstrap off of https://colorlib.com

WEB FUNCTIONALITY:

MuziApp is a website fit for music lovers, where users can share information about singles and albums by their most loved artists! 
They can also see what others have added, access their own profile and see the amount of songs they've posted, and have a personal list of all of their favourite songs.
